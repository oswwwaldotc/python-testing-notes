# Testing Suite Overview

This directory contains the test suite for the application, implementing both unittest and pytest frameworks.

## Test Files Structure

### Main Test Files
- `test_bank_account.py` - Tests for the BankAccount class functionality
- `test_user.py` - Tests for User class operations
- `test_calculator.py` - Basic calculator operations tests
- `test_api_client.py` - API client tests with request mocking
- `test.py` - Simple product calculation tests
- `test_pytest.py` - PyTest examples using parametrize
- `test_all_asserts.py` - Demonstration of various unittest assertions

### Test Organization
- `suites.py` - Test suite configuration for running specific test groups

## Key Testing Features Demonstrated

1. **Unit Testing Patterns**
   - Standard assertions
   - Setup and teardown
   - Test fixtures
   - Exception testing
   - Parameterized testing (pytest)

2. **Mocking**
   - Mock objects
   - Patch decorators
   - Side effects
   - DateTime mocking

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Faker library for test data generation
   - File handling in tests
   - Cleanup procedures

4. **Advanced Testing Features**
   - Subtests
   - Test skipping
   - Expected failures
   - Custom test suites

## Running the Tests

### Using unittest

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### Using pytest

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
python -m tests.suites
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- Proper test isolation
- Resource cleanup
- Mock usage for external dependencies
- Comprehensive assertion examples
- Test case organization
- Data-driven testing
